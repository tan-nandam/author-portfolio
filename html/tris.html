						<p>He Has No Voice, No Face, No Name, No Identity. But He Has An Intention. </p>
						<p>I’m Rivanah Bannerjee, a young and independent girl living alone in Mumbai. My parents love me, my boyfriend adores me and I have a great job. But here’s the thing: my life is in danger. </p>
					<p> Someone’s been following me, watching my every move, trying to control my life.  </p>
						<p>At first I thought it was a harmless prank to gain my attention. My roomie thinks he is a secret admirer. Is he? BTW, I call him Stranger. </p>
						<p>But why am I, of all people, of any interest to him? Unless there is something about my own story that I do not know . . . </p>
						<p>With every revelation, it seems the truth is far more twisted than Rivanah can imagine. Wickedly plotted, the Stranger trilogy will keep you on the edge of your seat until the last page. </p>
