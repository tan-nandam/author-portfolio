						<p>I’m Rivanah Bannerjee, 23/F/Mumbai. Some of you might already know how my life is on a razor edge. </p>
						<p>Those of you who don’t, just know this: I may be killed soon . . . by the Stranger. </p>
					<p>  I don’t know who or what he is: a ghost, a person or a figment of my imagination? </p>
						<p>All I know is he isn’t just one thing: he is sexy and scary, terrific and terrifying.</p>
						<p>What I don’t understand is why a young, harmless girl like me, who works in a big city, stays away from her parents and has a screwed-up love life, would be of any interest to him.</p>
						<p>Unless there is something about my own story that I do not know . . . </p>
						<p>In the hotly anticipated final instalment of the Stranger trilogy, Rivanah will learn the answers to her many questions—What is it that binds her to the dead Hiya? Who is the Stranger? Why has he been following her all this while?—leading to an intense, breathtaking climax.</p>
