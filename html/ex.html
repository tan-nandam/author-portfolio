						<p>Neel, the protagonist of this romance thriller book, has quit his boring job to cater to his passion of writing. </p>
						<p>This passion for writing literature takes this aspirant author to the Jaipur Literary Festival where he meets a lithe and enticing girl Nivrita, the commissioning editor of a leading publishing house. Nivrita claims to be his ex but Neel seems to remember nothing about this attractive temptress.</p>
					<p> Lured by an offer that is hard to resist and the mystery that Nivrita embodies, Neel soon finds himself getting too close to the mysterious Nivrita, and farther apart from his live-in girlfriend Titiksha. </p>
