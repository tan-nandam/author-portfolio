						<p>The questions that Rivanah wants an answer for, in this mystery allegory are; Who really is this stranger?</p>
						<p>What is his purpose of coming into Rivanahâ€™s life? Will he ever be able to contact her again?</p>
					<p> These types of questions have been troubling Rivanah continuously. Indifferent about the mystery surrounding this guy, she frantically wants the stranger back into her life. </p>
						<p>As the story further unfolds, the true facts that come to light are far from what Rivanah could ever imagine</p>
						<p>The story has a vicious and cruel plot with many mysteries unfolding themselves, as the reader divulges further into this tale.</p>
						<p>This gripping plot has the knack to make the reader bite his or her nails till the very last leaf of the book. </p>
