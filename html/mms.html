						<p>Rivanah Bannerjee is just another independent young woman who like other career centric women has a happening life. </p>
						<p>Her parents love her a lot and are open and liberal. Her boyfriend is full of love and admires her beauty.</p>
					<p> Plus, she is intelligent and has a promising career. Everything looks set for a 'happy life’ until the entry of a 'stranger’ in her life. </p>
						<p>This stranger is following her quietly and knows a lot of about her. He does not have a face or a voice but has an invitation which could destroy Rivanah’s happy life.</p>
						<p>Rivanah initially thought that the stranger might be secret admirer or an obsessed lover but very soon she realizes that this stranger is more than that.</p>
						<p>Can Rivanah curtail the advances of this stranger? Can police catch this intruder? Or is the stranger a result of her unforgettable past life? </p>
