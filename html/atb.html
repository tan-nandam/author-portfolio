						<p>What happens when life plays a trick on two innocent lovers?</p>
						<p>What happens when your first love much against all possibilities comes back to you in the most bizarre and astounding manifestation ever?</p>
						<p> Dr. Radhika Sharma, for the world outside, is an aberrant and arrogant feminist. But inside, she resides in a far-away world like vulnerable first sketch of an artist. One night an innocuous enquiry by a nine-year-old patient coaxes her to open someones personal diary.</p>
						<p>And, as she reads on, a bygone era comes to the forefront taking her through a cavalcade of exclusive events that life, love and friendship offer at the noon of adolescence. By the time she finishes reading diary, its already morning.</p>
						<p>And by night time she finds herself face to face with a question that defies logical explanation. Is falling in love a random act or a planned coincidence?</p>
						<p>Is attraction the missing link between souls? Will the light of true love outshine the dark shadow of destiny?</p>
